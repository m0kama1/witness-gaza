# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue, please do not open a public issue.
Instead, contact the maintainers privately with:
- A description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment (if known)

## Sensitive Data
Do not commit API keys or private datasets.
Use `.env.local` for local secrets and keep it out of version control.
