# Data Sources (Template)

Add sources you rely on for each metric or incident.

Recommended practice:
- Prefer primary/authoritative publishers (UN agencies, reputable NGOs, peer-reviewed work).
- Capture `publisher`, `publication date`, and an archived link if possible.

Example entry:
- Metric: Children affected
- Publisher: <publisher>
- URL: <url>
- Published: <YYYY-MM-DD>
- Notes: <scope/limitations>
